        Introduction

    <p>
    As a Computer Science Honours student at North-West University, I bring a strong technical background, an analytical
    mindset, and a genuine drive to deliver value in a professional setting.
    My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, data analysis, and systems
    thinking. Courses such as Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering have enhanced my problemsolving skills, while group projects have strengthened my communication and collaboration abilities. I take pride in being
    adaptable, detail-oriented, and proactive in learning new tools or concepts quickly.
    Beyond the classroom, I am passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems—especially within
    industries that rely on innovation, data, and strategic insight, such as financial services, consulting, and technology. I’m
    particularly interested in roles that offer a combination of technical challenges and client-facing responsibilities, where I
    can leverage both my logical reasoning and interpersonal skills.
